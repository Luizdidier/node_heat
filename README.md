## How to testing

As a prerequisite, you need to install the latest LTS version of Node.js and the front-end repository. After the api is running on your machine on port 4000 or can be changed according to your need, remember to always check the api ports on both the front-end and the back-end.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note:** you may need to use `sudo` to install dependencies if you are using Linux or MacOS.
